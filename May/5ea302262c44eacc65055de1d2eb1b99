On Monday, Uche Igwe, an on-air personality popularly known as Darksam, was arraigned before Yaba Magistrate court for allegedly sharing the sex video of a Chrisland Schools pupil. Mr Igwe, who works with Metro FM, Lagos state, is facing a two-count charge of cyberstalking and breach of peace, after being charged to court by the state government.

Mr Igwe reportedly shared a video clip involving five Chrisland students allegedly engaging in sexual activities at a World Schools Games in Dubai. He posted the viral video on Twitter in April. The incident prompted the Lagos State Government to shut down all the branches of the school, an action that has been reversed. The Prosecution counsel attached to the State Criminal Investigation Department Panti, Augustine Nwabuisi, appeared in court alongside the police officer in charge of the Legal Department at the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) Panti, Yetunde Cardoso The prosecution told the court that the defendant committed the offences on April 18. Mr Nwabuisi told the court that the defendant intentionally posted a video of the 10-year-old female student engaging in sexual intercourse with another student in Dubai, on his Twitter handle @uchedark.
