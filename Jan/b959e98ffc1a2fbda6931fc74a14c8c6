The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) has warned against wearing military uniforms and accoutrements for electioneering campaign posters by some politicians and other unauthorised persons. The Acting Director, Defence Information, Wap Maigida, gave the warning in a statement on Thursday in Abuja. Mr Maigida, an air commodore , said that the campaign posters of some governors, dressed in military camouflage uniforms, were displayed in noticeable areas in their respective states. He said the act was manifestly illegal and an abuse of the privilege of allowing civilians to wear military uniforms during military training exercises. According to him, it is necessary to restate that the Armed Forces of Nigeria, as a professional institution, remains apolitical and, as such, will not want to be dragged into any form of political bias. “Accordingly, it is important to advise politicians and others to desist from the use of military uniforms and accoutrements for political events and other engagements henceforth. “Please note, anyone found culpable in this regard would be liable to prosecution,” he warned.
