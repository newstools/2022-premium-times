The Napoli striker, who will miss the action at the African Cup of Nations starting this weekend in Cameroon, will be competing for honours in three categories. The 23-year-old was nominated in the Striker of the Year category alongside Kelechi Iheanacho and Paul Onuachu– who contributed a great deal to his club’s triumph in the Belgian Cup for the 2020–21 campaign.

The last nomination for Osimhen is in the King of Pitch category where he would be battling the duo of Wilfred Ndidi and the Onuachu again for the top diadem. In some of the other categories, reigning African Women’s Player of the Year Asisat Oshoala will slug it out with Gift Monday and Uchenna Kalu for the Queen of the Pitch award. A photo finish is expected in the Goalkeeper of the Year category where all three Super Eagles shot stoppers; Francis Uzoho, Maduka Okoye and Daniel Akpeyi have all been nominated.
