Tens of members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Friday defected to the All Progressives Party (APC) in Ikorodu. Receiving the defectors at the APC party secretariat, Abiodun Ogunleye, a former deputy governor of Lagos State, welcomed the defectors, assuring them of fairness and equity in their new party. “I welcome you to our great party, APC as new members, and assure you of all rights accrued to the rest of our members. “We will ensure that you benefit from every opportunity regarding the welfare of members without sentiments,” Mr Ogunleye said. He urged the defectors to get their Permanent Voters Card(PVC) and vote for APC in all elective positions in the 2023 general elections. Olayinka Adewale, who spoke on behalf of the. defectors said they were pleased with the way they were being received by members of their new party. He said they defected to the ruling party owing to what he called internal wranglings in the PDP in Ikorodu. Mr Adewale added that the emergence of a Southerner as the presidential candidate of APC also informed their defection, saying the victory of the ruling party in 2023 would not only benefit the zone but the country. “I am a delegate at the last PDP primaries and I was expecting the ticket to be zoned to the South. “Today we have taken a very important step to move to APC so that we can support the candidate of our choice,” he said.
