President Buhari assured the Chairman of BUA and Pioneer President of the Council of Federal Government’s unflinching support as top business leaders continue to build strategic partnerships aimed at improving business relations between the two countries, as well as supporting the economic programme of Government in the areas of infrastructural development, agriculture, power, job and wealth creation.
