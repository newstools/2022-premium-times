He said the police recovered from the suspects two locally made single barrel guns, two axes, two locally made pistols and some wraps of weeds suspected to be Indian hemp. Mr Abutu said the suspects during interrogation confessed to being members of an armed robbery gang, illicit drug dealers, and cultists. He said the suspects would be arraigned in court as soon as the investigation was concluded. (NAN) Donate TEXT AD: Call Willie - +2348098788999
