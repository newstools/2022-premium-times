The Police in Ogun on Wednesday said they have arrested a suspected Kuje prison escapee, Yakubu Abdulmumuni, at the Sango-Ota area of the state. The police spokesperson in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, in a statement issued to journalists in Ota, said the suspect was arrested on Monday. Mr Oyeyemi explained that Mr Abdulmumuni, 28, was arrested following information received by police officers at Divisional Headquarters, Sango-Ota, that the convict was sighted around the area. “Upon the information, the Divisional Police Officer, Sango-Ota Division, SP Saleh Dahiru, quickly mobilised his men and moved to the area where the convict was apprehended. “The convict confessed to the Police that he escaped from Kuje Correctional centre on July 5, when the centre was attacked by bandits. “Abdulmumuni stated further that he was convicted by Kogi state High Court for offence of conspiracy and culpable homicide and sent to Kuje Correctional Centre,” Mr Oyeyemi said. He said that the Commissioner of Police in the state, Lanre Bankole, had ordered the Criminal Investigation Department to transfer the convict to Correctional Center with immediate effect. Gunmen invaded the Kuje Correctional Centre last week, freeing hundreds of inmates, including Boko Haram suspects. The police have recaptured some of the inmates, including one at Suleja, Niger State, and another in Nasarawa State. Donate TEXT AD: Call Willie - +2348098788999
