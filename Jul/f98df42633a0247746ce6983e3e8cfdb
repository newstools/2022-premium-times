The Q3 2021 figure “represents a collection efficiency of 70.89 percent as compared to 68.9 percent recorded in 2021/Q2,” according to the NERC, which established deployment of meters through the National Mass Metering Programme funded through the Central Bank of Nigeria and the continuation of the Meter Asset Provider (MAP) scheme as the main drivers of performance.

Port Harcourt DisCo generated N12.25 billion in the quarter, an increase from the Q2 N11. 56 billion. Benin DisCos generated N14. 76 billion in the Q3 2021. Both Port Harcourt and Benin DisCos improved in collection efficiency from 60 percent and 55.2 percent to 66.1 per cent and 57.4 per cent respectively, translating to an increase of N690 million and N2.18 billion in that order in value terms. During the same period, Yola, Enugu, and Jos DisCos reported the greatest drop in collection efficiency from 52 percent, 67.2 percent, and 54.3 percent to 50 percent, 64.5 percent, and 50 percent respectively.
