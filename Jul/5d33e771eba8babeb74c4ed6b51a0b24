Ahead of the Osun State governorship election on Saturday, PREMIUM TIMES will host key electoral stakeholders to discuss lessons learnt from the Ekiti gubernatorial election weeks ago. The conversation will take place on Twitter Spaces – via this paper’s official handle. It will be anchored by Chiamaka Okafor, QueenEsther Iroanusi and co-hosted by the head of the Development Desk, Mojeed Alabi. Expected to do justice to the topic are Tobi Oluwatola, the Executive Director of the Centre for Journalism, Innovation and Development (CJID) and Azuka Ogugua, the spokesperson for the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC). Others are Samson Itodo, the Executive Director of Yiaga Africa and Ene Obi, convener of the Civil Societies Situation Room. With less than 72 hours to the Osun polls, Nigerians and the electoral umpire, INEC, are hopeful for a peaceful and credible exercise. The INEC chairman, Mahmoud Yakubu, is also optimistic that this time, there would be a lower record of violation of electoral laws – particularly vote buying, which he described as a “diabolic act.” This paper reported how the Ekiti election was marred by vote buying. Officials of top political parties like the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party were seen giving out cash ranging from N3,000 to N10,000 to the electorate before and after voting. Although some of the governorship candidates feigned ignorance about the case of vote buying, the anti-graft agency, EFCC, would later arrest some party agents caught buying votes. These are some of the issues that will be discussed at the Space later today as residents of Osun gear up to elect a governor who would drive the affairs of the state for the next four years. The conversation is scheduled to begin at 6p.m. Donate TEXT AD: Call Willie - +2348098788999
