Novak Djokovic came from a set down to beat Nick Kyrgios 4-6 6-3 6-3 7-6 in three hours on Centre Court on Sunday to claim a fourth consecutive title at SW19. The world No.1 claimed his first-ever victory over Kyrgios in three meetings to make it 21 Grand Slam titles, one ahead of Roger Federer and one behind Rafael Nadal, who withdrew from his semi-final against Kyrgios because of a stomach injury. Djokovic was deported from Australia in January and lost to Nadal in Paris before making up for lost time with his fourth consecutive title at Wimbledon. His COVID-19 status may prevent him from competing in the U.S for the U.S Open later in the year and his deportation from Australia means he cannot enter the country until 2026.
