Nigerian stocks dipped by 0.23 per cent on Wednesday, extending the drop recorded at the previous session as investors await the half-year financials of big and some mid-cap companies, which are likely to help the market break from its long flattish progress. The fall followed profit-taking actions by traders in the shares of Nigerian Breweries although intense sale of shares in GTCO also weighed. “We expect continued bargain hunting as investors continue to look forward to the H1-2022 earnings season, cherry-picking stocks with potential for strong earnings performance as well as interim dividend payment,” said analysts at United Capital in an outlook note for this week seen by PREMIUM TIMES. “However, we note that a strong hike in MPR at this week’s MPC meeting could spell bad news for the equities market,” they added.
