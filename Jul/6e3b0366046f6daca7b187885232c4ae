Nigerian stocks inched up 0.02 per cent on Wednesday, marking one week of flat trade that has seen the benchmark index recording little or no movement. Flat trade, a market situation whereby the volume of shares investors are willing to buy is the same or almost at par with the volume traders want to sell, has haunted the market for a while, causing uncertainty about where stocks might be headed next. With the recent monetary policy stance tightening the benchmark interest rate, the ray of hope for a bullish market in the near term will most likely depend on whether big-cap stocks report strong earnings and bottom-line when they begin to issue half-year results. “Outlook for the equities market is broadly dependent on three key things; Monetary Policy, Corporate Performance and Pre-election activities,” Ayorinde Akinloye, head of research at United Capital told PREMIUM TIMES. “Sustained hike in MPR that transitions into higher yield environment combined with a pressured electoral atmosphere would be bad for equities.” Market breadth was negative as 28 losers were reported compared to 11 gainers.
