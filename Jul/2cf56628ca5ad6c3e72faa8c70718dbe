The Oyo State House of Assembly on Monday approved the appointment of Adebayo Lawal as the new Deputy Governor, following the impeachment of Rauf Olaniyan. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the approval followed the nomination of Mr Lawal to the lawmakers for consideration by Governor Seyi Makinde as a replacement for Mr Olaniyan.
