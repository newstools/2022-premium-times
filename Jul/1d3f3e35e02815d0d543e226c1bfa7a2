Shares in the financial services firm had climbed up by 1.52 per cent as of 14:05 WAT on Lagos’s Custom Street after the news hit the market. United Capital, which also manages fund, realised N681.4 million as exchange gains, a key driver of growth this time around for a company recorded no earnings from that income source in the first six months of 2021. Its other services encompass trusteeship, security trading and wealth management.

Profit before income tax stood at N5.2 billion, up from N3.7 billion, while after-tax profit swelled by 41.2 per cent to N4.4 billion.
