Ademola Adeleke, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has cast his vote in the ongoing Osun governorship election. Mr Adeleke voted at ward 2, unit 9 in Ede North Local Government Area of the state. He arrived at the polling unit at 8:46am and was accredited by the electoral officials on duty at about 8:50am. The PDP candidate commended the electoral umpire, INEC and expressed satisfaction with the election process. He told journalists that everything is going well and that has been the situation from the information he has gotten from other voting areas. “I’m impressed with the electoral process at the moment; everything is going on smoothly. I will be on the ground to monitor things,” he said. Mr Adeleke is battling for the governorship seat with 14 other candidates including Gboyega Oyetola, the incumbent governor of Osun and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and Yusuff Lasun, former deputy speaker of the house of representatives and Labour Party (LP) candidate. In 2018, Mr Adeleke lost to Mr Oyetola in a keenly contested election. INEC has assured of its readiness to conduct a successful poll. The police and other security agencies have also deployed their personnel to protect the ballots and ensure a peaceful process. Civil Society Organisations (CSO) have similarly deployed observers across the state. The election will be contested in all the 30 local government areas, comprising 332 wards and 3,763 polling units. Follow PREMIUM TIMES live update here. Donate TEXT AD: Call Willie - +2348098788999
