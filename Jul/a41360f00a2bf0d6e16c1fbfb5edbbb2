Mr SonAllah, who attributed the cause of the accident to speed violation and loss of control, urged the motorists to install speed limit device in their vehicles and maintain speed limit. “We will continue to appeal to our drivers to always maintain speed limit when they are on wheel and installation of speed limit device is a must for them. “Moreover, this is rainy season, motorists must have functional wipers and drive with care because the person that died is a driver who left Ore to Akure this morning,” he said.
