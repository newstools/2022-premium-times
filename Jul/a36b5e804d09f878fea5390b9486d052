The Sector Commander of FRSC, Ahmed Umar, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ota, Ogun State, that five others were unhurt in the accident which occurred at about 10.10 p.m. on Saturday. Mr Umar explained that the accident involved three vehicles, which include a Toyota Camry marked AKD 670 HF, a Pick-up TATA and a truck, both without registration numbers. The sector commander explained further that six persons were involved in the crash, which led to the death of a person (passerby) and five people were unhurt. “The corpse of the victim was deposited at the morgue of General Hospital, Ifo,” he said.
