Former President Olusegun Obasanjo stunned residents of Abeokuta, Ogun State, on Saturday when he turned himself into a commercial tricycle rider, popularly called Keke, picking and dropping passengers across the capital. Mr Obasanjo started the trip from the Moshood Abiola Way end of the road, near the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) mega station. The former president, dressed in his native Yoruba native attire with a fez cap, was spotted carrying passengers from the take off spot and heading towards the end of the popular Kuto market in the town. The development, part of activities to mark his 85th birthday, excited the residents, many of whom ran after his Keke, eagerly attempting to board and ride with him. <img data-attachment-id="540404" data-permalink="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/540403-85th-birthday-obasanjo-becomes-keke-rider.html/attachment/img-20220702-wa0057" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/07/IMG-20220702-WA0057.jpg?fit=1080%2C753&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1080,753" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="IMG-20220702-WA0057" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Former President Obasanjo rides Okada to pick passengers&lt;/p&gt;
