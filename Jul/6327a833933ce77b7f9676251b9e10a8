Super Eagles player, Chidera Ejuke, has left Russian side CSKA Moscow and signed on loan with Bundesliga side, Hertha Berlin. Ejuke is the latest African player to leave the Russian Premier League after FIFA granted foreign players the caveat to suspend their contracts and move to other countries. The 24-year-old left the Russian league that has been on hold for a couple of months due to the invasion of Ukraine. According to the BBC the major reasons for Ejuke’s departure was because of this development and Super Eagles call-up. Ejuke was part of Austin Eguavoen’s team during the last AFCON in Cameroon but was missing from new manager, Jose Peseiro’s two AFCON qualifiers against Sierra Leone and Sao Tome. “It was an important decision for Ejuke to go somewhere he can continue to make a career progression,” the adviser told BBC Sport Africa. “He started well in the national team but has since fallen down the pecking order and been overlooked by the new Nigeria coach. “If he moves somewhere and plays regularly, he will hopefully get back into the national team and continue his development.” Meanwhile, Hertha Berlin’s Sporting Director Fredi Bobic believes Ejuke’s skill and knowledge of European leagues will be an asset to the German side. “Chidera [Ejuke] has proved himself in several European leagues already, and brings good skills alongside speed and versatility. We’re sure that he’ll improve our game with his abilities.” Ejuke said, “I’m looking forward to playing for Hertha, to the Bundesliga and this special challenge. I want to do my bit in helping the club achieve its goals.” Ejuke scored 10 goals in 55 appearances during his two-year spell with the 13-time Russia champions.
