Nigerian stocks did not change much on Friday as the benchmark index edged up by only 0.02 per cent, raising concerns that the market, which reached a high in the seven days to June 27, must have plateaued, and could be set for market correction proper in the week ahead. As much as a 46 per cent slide in trade volume was recorded. The main stock index, which measures the cumulative movement of all the stocks listed on the exchange, has seen little or no movement within the three days, a situation called flattish trade in stock market parlance. “We expect a reversal from the recent bullish close to last week. We expect investors to resume selling into strength as the main drivers of the negative sentiments are expected to remain. “Intensifying inflationary pressures, aggressive policy normalization, and recession fears are all factors poised to keep bullish sentiments in check,” analysts at investment bank United Capital said in an outlook note on Monday seen by PREMIUM TIMES. But that forecast seems to have come ahead of its time as no sharp decline was in trade this week. The observations will likely define next week’s trade given that the market seems to have entered the market correction zone. Yet, as the earnings season might emerge anytime soon, strong earnings release next week could prove a disruptive force that could drive trade and set stocks on an upward course once again.
