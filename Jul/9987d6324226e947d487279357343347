The police spokesperson in the state, Benjamin Hundeyin, said the operation was made possible on Thursday after a tip-off. “Following a tip-off, painstaking background check and verification, operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) have busted a fake Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) centre in Jobi Fele Way, Alausa Business District, Alausa, Ikeja,” the statement read. “Five suspects manning the centre were equally arrested for forgery and impersonating CAC officials. “Those arrested include Gloria Ukaegbu aged 28, Omolere Kayode aged 30, Taiwo Ajayi aged 34, Nwachukwu Brenda aged 27 and Oluwatomisin Adebisi aged 25.” The police said that the operation was led by Olayinka Egbeyemi, the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) commander.
