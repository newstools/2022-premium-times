Starling Pictures on Friday unveiled the trailer for its blockbuster movie, The Stranger I Know. Produced by Aderonke Moyinlorun and directed by Akin Tijani Balogun, the movie parades some of Nollywood’s finest actors. They include Toyin Abraham, Deyemi Okanlawon, Aderonke Moyinlorun, Akin Lewis, Bimbo Akintola and Dayo Amusa. Set in Lagos and the United States of America, The Stranger I Know tells the story of an up-and-coming actress who gets her first lead role in a big-budget Nollywood movie. She moves to Lagos and falls in love with her short-let landlord, a guy she just met. They have so much in common bizarrely and scarily, which begs the question: Is this only a mere coincidence, or is there more to it than meets the eye?

Our cast and crew did an excellent job, and I cannot wait for you all to experience the magic we have created. “The movie is an original take that blends ancient tradition with the modern way of life and love.
