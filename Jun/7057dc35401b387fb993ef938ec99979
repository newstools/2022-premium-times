The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved reforms to shore up the non-oil revenue to N3.8 trillion and oil revenue to N160 billion annually. Laolu Akande, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, briefed State House correspondents after the FEC meeting on Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The meeting was presided over by the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as President Muhammadu Buhari is on a state visit to Portugal. Mr Akande said the reforms would boost federal government’s finance especially the non-oil revenue. “Among several of the memos presented was the one by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning on Accelerating Revenue Moblisation Reforms which is a derivative of Federal Government’s Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative. “The significant progress that has been made in that initiative includes the raising of the Value Added Tax (VAT) from five per cent to seven per cent and other measures since 2019. “This particular initiative is something meant to address some of the fiscal challenges of the federal government as it is intended to raise Nigeria’s non-oil revenue potential. <img data-attachment-id="539854" data-permalink="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/539852-fec-okays-reforms-to-bolster-non-oil-revenue-to-n3-8trn-annually.html/attachment/fwayinxxwamsixr" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/06/FWaYiNXXwAMSIxR.jpg?fit=1280%2C852&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1280,852" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Vice President Yemi Osinbajo SAN presides over the Federal Executive Council Meeting this morning at the Statehouse, Abuja. 29th June, 2022." data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Vice President Yemi Osinbajo SAN presides over the Federal Executive Council Meeting this morning at the Statehouse, Abuja. 29th June, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
