The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Ogun 1 Area Command, has impounded two trucks loaded with smuggled foreign rice. The trucks have Dangote inscribed on them. One of the trucks has a registration number, ICT-17F-014, while the other was not registered. While speaking at the command’s headquarters in Idiroko border, on Monday, the Controller, Bamidele Makinde, said the two trucks were conveying 1,764 bags of 50kg foreign parboiled rice along Abeokuta when his officers intercepted them. He, however, could not ascertain if the trucks belong to Dangote Cement, explaining that most of the trucks are owned by franchisees of the factory. Mr Makinde said between May and June 27, customs officials in Ogun seized 8,417 bags of rice, valued at N131,145,277. <img data-attachment-id="539546" data-permalink="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-west/539535-customs-impound-trucks-loaded-with-smuggled-rice.html/attachment/dangote-trucks-used-for-smuggling-impounded-in-ogun" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/06/Dangote-trucks-used-for-smuggling-impounded-in-Ogun.jpg?fit=1040%2C780&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1040,780" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Dangote trucks used for smuggling, impounded in Ogun" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Dangote trucks used for smuggling, impounded in Ogun&lt;/p&gt;
