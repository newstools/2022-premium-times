At the Uyo and Abuja street markets, dealers exchanged the naira at N604.00 and sold N608.00 to a dollar at Uyo, while Abuja dealers sold at no fixed price on Monday. Exchangers at the black market attributed the continuous fall of the naira against the dollar to scarcity of forex they are currently experiencing. “We used to get over $20,000 if we wanted to buy before, but now we struggle to buy even $2000,” said Shuaibu, a currency dealer at Uyo street market. “It is the scarcity of dollars that is driving the high exchange rate,” he added. <img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; align: center;" src="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/05/Citizen-FM.jpg?ssl=1" alt="CITIZEN-FM AD" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Donate TEXT AD: Call Willie - +2348098788999 <img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; align: center;" src="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2019/06/pt-magazine-advert.gif?ssl=1" alt="PT Mag Campaign AD" data-recalc-dims="1" />
