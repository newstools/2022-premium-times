Nigerian philanthropist, politician and businessman, Nasiru Danu, has donated two giant Argentine polo ponies (horses) to the Nigerian Navy Polo Club. The donation which was made at an elaborate event at the Nigerian Army Guards Polo Club on Friday attracted dignitaries from across the country.   In his remarks, Director of Administration of the Navy, Kennedy Egbuchulam, revealed that though the Navy polo team was established in September 2021, less than a year ago, it has excelled in many competitions by winning trophies.   He said there are about 350 breeds of ponies in the world and out of the number, four stands out and that the Argentine horse is part of.   He said the team won trophies in recently concluded tournaments in Lagos and Port Harcourt.   “We know that polo is military and military is polo, we have no reason not to involve the Navy. “We want to encourage them to do more due to what they have done in less than one year.   While appreciating the philanthropic gesture, Mr Gambo, a vice admiral, said he was elated to be in the midst of the special gathering on taking over of the two ponies.   The navy polo group defeated the Army recently in a polo tournament in Abuja.   “On this note I wish to appreciate Danu on the honor done to the Nigerian Navy, the Navy and its polo team will continue to relish this kind gesture,” he said.   <img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; align: center;" src="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/05/Citizen-FM.jpg?ssl=1" alt="CITIZEN-FM AD" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Donate TEXT AD: Call Willie - +2348098788999 <img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; align: center;" src="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2019/06/pt-magazine-advert.gif?ssl=1" alt="PT Mag Campaign AD" data-recalc-dims="1" />
