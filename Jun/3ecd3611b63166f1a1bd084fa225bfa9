Two persons have been confirmed dead, while five others sustained injuries in an accident involving a Toyota Hiace bus and a Mercedes truck at the Mowe bus stop on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway on Monday. The Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun, Ahmed Umar, confirmed the incident to journalists in Abeokuta. It came barely two days after four people died and eight others were injured in an accident at the Ogunmakin axis of the expressway. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Mowe is located in Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of Ogun. Mr Umar attributed the accident to speeding and dangerous driving on the part of the bus driver which led to him ramming into the moving truck. He stated that the accident involving a Toyota Hiace bus marked: GMT 641 XL and a Benz truck, with registration number: KSF 320 XX occurred at 12:20 p.m. on Monday. “A total of 20 men were involved in the accident, five of whom got injured while two deaths were recorded,” he said. The FRSC boss stated that the injured victims had been taken to Famobis Hospital, Mowe, while the deceased were taken away by their families. He cautioned motorists against excessive speed and dangerous driving, pointing out the rate at which most commercial drivers had refused to obey common driving rules and regulations. Mr Umar warned that any vehicle caught without a speed limiting device would be sanctioned accordingly.
