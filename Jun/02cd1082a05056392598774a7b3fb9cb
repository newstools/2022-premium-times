He addressed journalists after casting his vote. While commended the electoral umpire, INEC and its officials, he said it is “too early to pass a judgement on its performance yet.” “If everything goes peaceful, INEC would have been given a pass mark at the end of the day. It is very early. We cannot passed a judgement yet on what INEC has done. “Going by my experience here, it has been peaceful. The people are calm, all queued up to vote. And the officers were dutiful.” He added that there was no technical glitch as the BVAS worked and hoped for victory for his party.
