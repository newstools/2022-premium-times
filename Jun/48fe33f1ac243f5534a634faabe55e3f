Frank Udeme, one of the co-defendants of Evans, had been sentenced to five years imprisonment on March 11. Mr Udeme had pleaded guilty to selling firearms to Evans. According to the prosecution, Evans and Mr Emeka committed the offence on August 27, 2013, at Third Avenue in Festac Town, Lagos. Evans and his accomplice are alleged to have killed one Ngozi Chijioke and attempted to kidnap and kill Mr Obianodo. The defendants pleaded not guilty to a seven-count charge of murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, attempt to kidnap, and sale and transfer of firearms over the attempted kidnap of Mr Obianodo. NAN also report that the sister case before Mrs Taiwo has also been adjourned until July 25 for the second defendant to open his defence. The court had on June 15 rejected the submission of the new counsel to Evans, Amobi Nzelu, to postpone the trial.

Evans had on February 4 opened his defence and denied kidnapping Mr Ahamonu and collecting $420,000 ransom from his family.   NAN also reports that the judge expressed dissatisfaction at the absence of the defendants on March 28 which stalled the trial.
