KEY POINTS: In the 2008 spy movie Body of Lies, the fictional character Hani Salaam helped CIA agents portrayed by Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio to catch terrorists. What cinema-goers may not have realized was that Salaam’s character was based on a real person: a Jordanian spymaster named Sa’ad Kheir. Mr Kheir headed Jordan’s General Intelligence Directorate (GID) between 2000 and 2005, acting as a key U.S. ally in the War on Terror. But though lionized in theaters as a stylish hero helping the U.S., Mr Kheir’s real-life activities were more morally questionable. As well as allegedly smuggling oil, he oversaw Jordan’s role in America’s extraordinary rendition programme, running an agency accused of torturing prisoners and overseeing kangaroo courts. In 2003, he opened a personal account at Credit Suisse. Over the next seven years, the account would grow to 28.3 million Swiss francs (U.S.$21.5 million) at its peak, before being closed months after his death in 2009. Mr Kheir was not the only spy who stashed large sums of money at Credit Suisse. Journalists found that 15 leading intelligence figures from around the world, and a number of their family members, were also clients of the bank. The revelations come from a huge trove of leaked Credit Suisse banking data containing client information from the 1940s until well into the last decade. <img data-attachment-id="512630" data-permalink="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/512605-suissesecrets-bank-of-spies-credit-suisse-catered-to-global-intelligence-figures.html/attachment/suisse-secrets-investigation" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Suisse-Secrets-Investigation-.png?fit=700%2C513&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="700,513" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Suisse Secrets Investigation" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Suisse-Secrets-Investigation-.png?fit=476%2C349&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Suisse-Secrets-Investigation-.png?fit=700%2C513&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-512630" src="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Suisse-Secrets-Investigation-.png?resize=700%2C513&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="513" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Suisse-Secrets-Investigation-.png?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Suisse-Secrets-Investigation-.png?resize=476%2C349&amp;ssl=1 476w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Most of the 15 were top-tier spy chiefs in their country. The data also held a number of other spies that OCCRP has chosen not to name, because their identities could not be verified beyond absolute doubt. Along with Kheir, three spy chiefs in the data whose careers have common threads that make them stand out: Egypt’s Omar Suleiman, Pakistan’s General Akhtar Abdur Rahman and Yemen’s Ghaleb Al-Qamish. All four ran state intelligence agencies where they controlled large black budgets that were above parliamentary and executive scrutiny. All of these figures or their family members also held personal accounts at Credit Suisse worth large sums of money, without obvious sources of personal income that could explain the wealth. <img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; align: center;" src="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Farm-yield-3.jpg?ssl=1" alt="NIRSAL AD" data-recalc-dims="1" /> All four had roles in key U.S. interventions in the Middle East and Afghanistan, from the CIA’s early attempts to back anti-Soviet mujahideen in the late 1970s, to the first Gulf War in 1990, to the so-called “forever wars” launched in Afghanistan and Iraq since 2001. Three of the figures, Messrs Qamish, Suleiman and Kheir, were in charge of agencies that were well known for being involved in torture. At least eight of their family members also had Credit Suisse accounts. Since these intelligence officials would be considered “politically exposed persons,” their accounts should have been carefully scrutinized and should have raised questions for Credit Suisse. According to Swiss compliance expert Monika Roth, secret service agents are considered by banks to be particularly sensitive customers. “I wouldn’t take them as clients — that is far too risky,” Ms Roth said, adding that intelligence chiefs are often “people with a great deal of power, questionable connections and very opaque sources of money.” One former Credit Suisse executive told OCCRP: “In the example of an intelligence chief like Saad Kheir, opening an account is a red flag and many banks in Switzerland would not take it, but Credit Suisse would.” It is not clear what, if any, due diligence processes were carried out. Credit Suisse declined to comment on individual cases, citing Swiss banking laws that prohibit banks from identifying or providing information on clients. The bank said it “operates its business in compliance with all applicable global and local laws and regulations” and that it had strengthened its “risk management framework and control systems.” Long before Mr Kheir was building his account at Credit Suisse, secretive officials who helped America fight a proxy war against the Soviets in Afghanistan made their own connections to the institution.   In the late 1970s, the U.S. backed seven different factions of Islamist fighters called the mujahideen who were battling Russia’s presence in Afghanistan. Saudi Arabia matched U.S. funding to the jihadists dollar for dollar, often sending the money to the CIA’s Swiss bank account. The end recipient in the process was Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence group (ISI), led by General Rahman. By the mid-1980s, Mr Akhtar was adept at getting CIA cash into the hands of Afghan jihadists. It was around this time that Credit Suisse accounts were opened in the names of his three sons. As Mohammad Yousaf, a colleague of Akhtar’s at the ISI who later penned a book about the time, wrote: “The combined [U.S. and Saudi] funds, running into several hundred million dollars a year, were transferred by the CIA to special accounts in Pakistan under the control of ISI.” Both Yousaf and Steve Coll — author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 book Ghost Wars — claim Mr Akhtar was the man who decided where this cash went next. To train the mujahideen in sophisticated weaponry, the CIA trusted him with millions. By 1984, the CIA’s Afghanistan budget alone was some $200 million. Oversight was chronically lax, and Mr Akhtar’s role has long been questioned. One South Asian intelligence source with knowledge of Afghanistan operations told OCCRP: “It was easy at that point in time to open Swiss banking accounts of any manner or type for transfer of overt funds.” “Akhtar was doing it to fill his own pockets,” the source said. “A lot of money was siphoned off from the Afghan war and into his bank accounts.” One of the two Akhtar family accounts at Credit Suisse — held jointly by Mr Akhtar’s sons Akbar, Ghazi, and Haroon — was opened on July 1, 1985, when the sons were in their late 20s and early 30s. That same year, U.S. President Ronald Reagan would raise concerns about where the money intended for the mujahideen was going. By 2003, this account was worth at least five million Swiss francs ($3.7 million). A second account, opened in January 1986 in Akbar’s name alone, was worth more than 9 million Swiss francs ($9.2 million) by November 2010. Mr Akhtar died in a 1988 plane crash that also claimed his boss, Pakistani dictator Zia-ul-Haq.
Akbar and Haroon Khan did not respond to requests for comment. In a message to OCCRP, Ghazi Khan called information presented by reporters about the family’s Swiss accounts “not correct,” and said it was “denied,” but did not elaborate. As the CIA and Mr Akhtar were collaborating on Afghanistan, Yemen’s Ghaleb Al-Qamish was starting his own rise. By 1980, Mr Qamish headed Yemen’s Political Security Office (PSO), which was in charge of domestic intelligence. Just as Akhtar was doing from Pakistan, Qamish recruited fighters for the Afghan war against the Soviets. A looming figure over Yemen’s security apparatus for decades, Mr Qamish was a key enforcer for strongman President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who ruled from 1978 to 2012. When Al-Qaeda bombed the American destroyer U.S.S. Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden in 2000, Mr Saleh tasked an initially reluctant Mr Qamish with helping the CIA flush out the suspects.   According to three officers who worked under Mr Qamish at Yemen’s PSO, he was the nation’s most feared security official, described as Mr Saleh’s “black box.” The three sources, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, told OCCRP that Mr Qamish had “an open budget made up of millions of dollars” to do with as he pleased. By the time he had become Yemen’s chief spy, helping the Americans to unravel terror cells in the early 2000s, Mr Qamish also had inexplicable millions tucked away at Credit Suisse. His account, opened in 1999, the year before the Cole attack, was worth almost 5 million Swiss francs ($3.7 million) by 2006, the same year that some of the Cole suspects escaped a Yemeni prison. Mr Qamish’s monthly salary was probably between $4,000 and $5,000 a month, including allowances and bonuses, according to the former intelligence officers and official Yemeni salary law guidelines. Mr Qamish was accused of various abuses, including participating in the U.S. extraordinary rendition programme, which saw millions in CIA funds lavished on officials and other helpers in allied countries. Official documents show huge payments were made to countries that hosted black sites, and those who performed torture and interrogations. <img data-attachment-id="512631" data-permalink="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/512605-suissesecrets-bank-of-spies-credit-suisse-catered-to-global-intelligence-figures.html/attachment/extraodinary-rendition" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Extraodinary-Rendition.png?fit=700%2C275&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="700,275" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Extraodinary Rendition" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Extraodinary-Rendition.png?fit=526%2C207&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Extraodinary-Rendition.png?fit=700%2C275&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-512631" src="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Extraodinary-Rendition.png?resize=700%2C275&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="275" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Extraodinary-Rendition.png?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Extraodinary-Rendition.png?resize=526%2C207&amp;ssl=1 526w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Ruth Blakeley of the Rendition Project, a group of U.K. academics who have investigated the U.S. programme, said any new information that torture-linked intelligence figures had money secreted away should be investigated. “If there is evidence that senior intelligence officials were gaining financially from collusion in the rendition, detention, and interrogation program led by the CIA, then that warrants thorough investigation,” she said. If Credit Suisse questioned the source of Mr Qamish’s money or his fitness as a client, that did not deter the bank from dealing with him. His accounts lasted long after his involvement both in the rendition programme and the repression of Yemeni political opponents. “Through the PSO, [Qamish] was in charge of arresting all elements that were seen as opponents of the regime of Saleh,” said one senior officer, while another added: “No one knew how the PSO money was spent.” Mr Qamish’s ties to Mr Saleh frayed when the president began preparing a son to take charge of the country. Mr Saleh also set up a new domestic intelligence unit, the National Security Bureau, in 2002, under the command of a nephew, which quickly overshadowed the PSO. Slowly, the leader began pulling the rug from under Qamish’s feet. Mr Qamish removed the last of his assets from Credit Suisse — worth about 3.8 million Swiss francs ($4 million) — in January 2011, just as crowds were taking to the streets of Aden in the first sparks of the Arab Spring. Though removed from his role as PSO chief in 2014 by President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, who had come to power after Mr Saleh’s overthrow, he was made an ambassador, though he was not officially posted anywhere. Nowadays, Mr Qamish lives in Istanbul. In recent years he has taken a back seat, but his sons apparently remain active in business in Yemen, Bahrain, Brazil, and Turkey. Mr Qamish did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In a January 2009 diplomatic cable leaked to Wikileaks, Margaret Scobey, the U.S. ambassador to Egypt, said spy chief Omar Suleiman was used by the Hosni Mubarak dictatorship as an enforcer. She added that Mr Mubarak was “not one to lose sleep” over Mr Suleiman’s brutal methods. Credit Suisse did not seem overly worried about Mr Suleiman either. Despite the fact that he was personally linked to torture by victims of the U.S.’s rendition programme, Mr Suleiman’s family kept much of their wealth with the bank. In February 2003, while the U.S. hatched plans to invade Iraq, Mr Suleiman’s family were making preparations of their own: financial ones. That month, a Credit Suisse account in their names was opened. It would later swell by millions. Like Messrs Akhtar, Kheir and Qamish, Mr Suleiman was seen as a trusted U.S. ally. Weeks before the Suleimans’ account was opened, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, speaking to the United Nations, outlined why President Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq urgently needed to be toppled. When Mr Powell told the U.N. he had evidence of Iraq’s training of Al-Qaeda in chemical weaponry, the source he relied on was a victim of Mr Suleiman’s intelligence regime: Ibn Sheikh Al-Libi. Al-Libi, a Libyan, had been captured in Pakistan in 2001 before being rendered by the CIA to Egypt in 2003. He would confess, Egyptian handlers told him, because “three thousand individuals had been in the chair before him,” and they had all done so. After being squashed inside a tiny box, Al-Libi would later say he told the Egyptians “what they wanted to hear.” Mr Suleiman tended to get what he wanted. As the Iraq War moved from pitched battles into a counter-insurgency, Suleiman’s family’s wealth bulged. By 2007, four years after the fall of Saddam Hussein, the Suleiman account at Credit Suisse was worth 63 million Swiss francs, shared between Omar’s three daughters. The Suleiman family did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The account outlived Egypt’s Mubarak dictatorship, which fell in 2011 under the weight of the Arab Spring. After Mubarak was ousted, Swiss authorities said they were freezing the assets of about a dozen figures linked to him and his government. But it seems the crackdown didn’t apply to the Suleimans. Credit Suisse continued to maintain their accounts despite multiple concerns raised elsewhere about the crimes of the patriarch. Besides overseeing torture, Mr Suleiman was also involved in the agency’s clandestine financial transactions. At Mr Mubarak’s trial, a judge cited testimony from mr Suleiman and other officials that Hussein Salem — an Egyptian tycoon and known frontman for the intelligence service — owned a variety of companies in gas and other sectors for the spy agency. The judge wrote that Mr Suleiman had admitted that his intelligence agency set up front firms for “national security” reasons, often using Salem. Mr Salem was also a Credit Suisse client. He had several accounts, with one holding assets worth 105 million Swiss francs ($79.3 million) by 2003. It was named in legal proceedings when investigators alleged that it had been used to pay and receive what looked like corrupt commissions to executives at FlowTex, a German company prosecuted for massive fraud. The origin of their fortunes may never be known, but experts say cases like those of the Akhtar, Kheir, Qamish, and the Suleiman family raise questions about how intelligence leaders may have benefitted from illegality. “Don’t forget that Mubarak wanted his generals and intelligence chiefs to steal money,” said Robert Baer, an ex-CIA agent who served in the Middle East. “Because anybody who’s not making money in a position like that can’t be trusted. Those are the people that make coups d’etat.” Jordan’s Sa’ad Kheir was made for the big screen. The Washington Post’s David Ignatius, who wrote the novel upon which the movie Body of Lies was based, described him as “brilliant but emotionally wounded.” But the interrogations carried out by Mr Kheir’s GID were highly illegal, according to reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch reported that the GID served as “proxy jailer” for the CIA, “holding prisoners that the CIA apparently wanted kept out of circulation,” just as Suleiman’s intelligence forces had done in Egypt. The rights group documented at least 14 prisoners the U.S. sent to Jordanian custody for likely torture between 2001 and 2003. Amnesty International, citing victim testimony, reported that the GID obtained more than 100 confessions via torture, and then sent these cases to Jordan’s State Security Court, which handed out death penalties to the most unfortunate. Senior GID officials would later deny holding prisoners for the U.S., or that torture even happened. Mr Kheir has also been stalked by rumours of corruption involving oil trades, but no charges were ever filed. According to Wikileaks diplomatic cables, former Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb (2000-2003) put Mr Kheir at the heart of oil deals involving Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. <img data-attachment-id="512633" data-permalink="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/512605-suissesecrets-bank-of-spies-credit-suisse-catered-to-global-intelligence-figures.html/attachment/iraq-oil-on-the-cheap" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Iraq-oil-on-the-cheap.png?fit=695%2C815&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="695,815" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Iraq oil on the cheap" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Iraq-oil-on-the-cheap.png?fit=298%2C349&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Iraq-oil-on-the-cheap.png?fit=695%2C815&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-512633" src="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Iraq-oil-on-the-cheap.png?resize=695%2C815&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="695" height="815" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Iraq-oil-on-the-cheap.png?w=695&amp;ssl=1 695w, https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2022/02/Iraq-oil-on-the-cheap.png?resize=298%2C349&amp;ssl=1 298w" sizes="(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> “Kheir, along with then-Prime Minister Abul Ragheb, institutionalized high-level corruption that continues to haunt Jordan today,” a Jordanian politician told OCCRP. Mr Kheir’s run, however, would eventually come to an end. In May 2005, he was removed from his GID post by King Abdullah. Mr Kheir died at a luxury hotel in Vienna in December that year. Three years earlier, his account at the bank was worth 28.3 million Swiss francs. A Credit Suisse account opened in 2006 by Kheir’s brother Saeed, a ground engineer for King Hussein’s two private jets, was worth 13 million Swiss francs by 2011, before being closed in 2014. Mr Kheir’s wife at the time of his death, Janiche Frayeh, had her own account that was worth 6 million Swiss francs ($5.9 million) in 2010. Her account also closed in 2014. Saeed Kheir told OCCRP that given his brother Sa’ad’s sensitive position, “it should not surprise you that he never shared any information with me about his work in intelligence.” He said he knew nothing of any Credit Suisse account set up by his brother, and that he himself never set up any accounts. He said all his taxable income “has been declared to the tax authority in Jordan.” He said he never shared a bank account with, or received funds from, his brother. In a message to OCCRP, Ms Frayeh said questions about the family accounts at Credit Suisse were “weird and strange and outrageous.” She described Mr Kheir as “an honorable man who fought terrorism all his life so people like myself and your group can live safely in this life.” She said she had not opened a Credit Suisse account, had “no idea” about any funds there, and was merely a “house wife.” For intelligence figures, working with Credit Suisse offered a service that was hard to find in an increasingly globalized world. “These banks represent something that for the intelligence community is very precious: secrecy,” said one European intelligence officer on condition of anonymity. “This confidentiality makes their services very useful for covert operations.” A former German intelligence director in the Middle East told OCCRP and partners he was not surprised that high-ranking secret service employees from undemocratic countries would bank in Switzerland. Such accounts can serve as a back-up, the source suggested, set aside in the event that the regimes these spies serve are overthrown, or they themselves fall out of favor. This hypothesis was echoed by Mr Baer, the ex-CIA agent. “In the Arab world, you’re only in your job for so long,” said Mr Baer. “You and your clan have to steal what you can and create a nest egg. Switzerland is the safest place, once you’ve got your accounts set up.” Losing favour, it seems, is one of the main hazards of the spy world. After the fall of Mr Mubarak in 2011, Mr Suleiman threw his hat into the ring to lead Egypt, but was disqualified as a candidate. He died at the Cleveland Clinic months later, in July 2012, of natural causes. Requests for comment to the Suleiman family went unanswered. Spies also have practical problems that Swiss banking may have helped solve. “Spy agencies and terrorist organizations sometimes work in the same way,” said ex-Mossad officer Avner Avraham. “They have the same problems. They have to transfer money from point A to point B, to pay someone, and they don’t want anyone to know who’s the one paying and how it’s being transferred, or where it’s coming from.” Graham Barrow, a U.K.-based financial crime expert, said the enormous sums involved in Credit Suisse accounts connected to intelligence figures should have raised red flags for the bank. “There’s no reason why a senior intelligence operative can’t open a bank account, but they’ve got to give a reason why they want that account and what they’re going to use it for,” he said. “Then the account has got to be used in the way they said they were going to use it. “If at any point there’s a discrepancy, the bank should be raising red flags.” These four are the tip of the iceberg. Journalists found almost 40 accounts in the Credit Suisse data linked to intelligence officials from almost a dozen countries. These include:  Mr Aguilera opened one account at Credit Suisse in June 2011 and within a few months it was worth almost 7.8 million Swiss francs ($8.6 million). Another, linked to a legal entity he controlled, was opened in July 2011 and held a maximum value of almost 5 million Swiss francs. Mr Shinkafi died in London on July 6, 2016.
